Welcome this blog!

This blog serves as a simple showcase of μblog-py.

With μblog-py you can create very elegant, minimalistic blog sites, without the need
for large web frameworks. Out of the box, it doesn't include any javascript, but that
can easiely be added by the user, if desired.

The posts are written in Markdown, and converted to HTML, by using a local copy of the [markdown2 module][1].

For more information, you can find this project on [GitHub][2].
This project is a Python port of [μblog][3], with minor changes. It primarily gets rid of all dependencies other
than Python itself, and works as well on Unix as on Windows.
